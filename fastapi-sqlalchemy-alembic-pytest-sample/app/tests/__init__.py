To resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`, we need to ensure that all necessary modules are correctly imported and exist within the repository. Since the content of the `__init__.py` file is currently empty, it might be necessary to create or adjust the imports based on the existing structure of the repository. Here's a potential update for the `__init__.py` file in the `app/tests` directory:

```python
# This file is intentionally left blank to treat the 'tests' directory as a package.
```

If there are specific modules or files that should be imported here based on the repository's structure, they should be added accordingly. However, without additional context or specific module names, the above content is a safe default to ensure the `tests` directory is recognized as a package. If there are specific test modules that need to be imported, you would list them here.
