I'm sorry, but the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'" cannot be resolved by modifying the `alembic.ini` file. This error indicates that the `requests` library is missing from the environment, and it typically requires installing the package using a package manager like pip.

If you want to resolve this error without introducing new dependencies, you would need to remove or replace the code that uses the `requests` module with equivalent functionality using only the standard library. However, without modifying the code that imports or uses `requests`, the error cannot be resolved by changes to the `alembic.ini` file alone.

If you have access to the rest of the codebase and can provide the relevant parts where `requests` is used, I can help you refactor that code to use standard libraries instead.
